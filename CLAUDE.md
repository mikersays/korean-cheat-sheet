# Korean Cheat Sheet — Project Notes

Static GitHub Pages site teaching Korean grammar. Has a sister repo that teaches reading Hangul, and the two are designed to be maintained together.

## Repo topology

- **This repo** — `mikersays/korean-cheat-sheet` → https://mikersays.github.io/korean-cheat-sheet/
  - `grammar-cheatsheet.html` — the cheat sheet (CSS + content in one file). Source of truth.
  - `exercises.html` — practice companion. Sections `s0`–`s23` mirror cheat-sheet section IDs (note: `s17` and `s22` intentionally skipped). Click-to-reveal answers via `<details class="ex-answer"><summary>답</summary>…</details>`. Linked from the cheat sheet in three places.
  - `flashcards.html` — click-to-flip card deck (3D flip via `transform: rotateY`). Cards are an embedded JS array drawn from all 25 cheat-sheet sections. Filter dropdown, shuffle, keyboard (`Space` flip, `←`/`→` navigate). Single column, no sidebar.
  - `index.html` — meta-refresh redirect to the cheat sheet.
  - `grammar-cheatsheet.md` — earlier markdown source, kept for reference.
  - `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs}/` — dated design notes (e.g. `2026-04-26-grammar-practice-page-*.md`). Reference only; not deployed.
- **Sister repo** — `mikersays/hangeul-reading-guide` → https://mikersays.github.io/hangeul-reading-guide/
  - Local path: `../hangeul-reading-guide/`
  - Same single-HTML-file layout, same CSS lifted from this repo
  - Teaches Hangul reading as a prerequisite to the cheat sheet
  - **When changing shared CSS, update both files.** They were lifted from a single source and have drifted only by intentional additions.

Both Pages sites: branch `main`, path `/`, build_type `legacy`. No build step — push and it's live in ~30s.

## Aesthetic — non-negotiable

Vermillion seal / hanji paper aesthetic. CSS variables in `:root` (and dark mode override) define the whole palette: `--paper`, `--ink`, `--vermillion`, `--celadon`, etc. **Don't introduce new colors outside the variables.**

Fonts: Fraunces (display), Newsreader (body serif), Gowun Batang (Korean), IBM Plex Sans (UI/labels), JetBrains Mono (code/IPA). All from Google Fonts via the single `<link>`.

Section headers use a vermillion seal-stamp number (`<span class="num">NN</span>`) rotated -2°. Callouts use a 註 mark in the corner. Pre blocks have a vermillion left rule. Don't add competing visual motifs.

## Markup classes (shared across both files)

- `.ko` — inline Korean text (Gowun Batang, `word-break: keep-all`)
- `.en` — small italic muted English gloss below Korean in table cells (`display: block`)
- `.ipa` — IPA pronunciation badge, monospace celadon, `[bracketed]` (sister repo only currently — promote here if needed)
- `.callout` — vermillion sidenote with 註 mark; use `.callout a` (which has a class-level rule) — **never inline-style** cross-links
- `<pre><code>` — example sentence blocks with the vermillion margin rule
- `<table>` — standard; tables become `display: block; overflow-x: auto` at ≤880px
- `ol.tree` — decision-tree numbered steps with seal-stamp markers
- `.endings` — two-column quick reference (used in §23)

Sister repo also has: `.jamo-grid` / `.jamo-cell`, `.walk` / `.step`, `.diagram` (inline SVG). Don't add those here unless a section needs them.

**Practice page only** (`exercises.html`):

- `.ex` — exercise card (vermillion left rule, paper-soft background)
- `.ex-head` / `.ex-num` / `.ex-type` — header row: number + small celadon uppercase type label (`identify`, `choose`, `write`, `build`, etc.)
- `.ex-prompt` — question body; `.ex-prompt ul.ex-choices` for multiple-choice options (rendered with ○ markers)
- `details.ex-answer` + `<summary>답</summary>` — vermillion stamp-style reveal button. A `beforeprint` handler force-opens all `<details>` so printed copies show solutions.
- `.ex-solution` — answer block (paper background, vermillion left rule)
- `.section-lede` — italic intro paragraph that links back to the matching cheat-sheet section

**Flash cards only** (`flashcards.html`):

- `.toolbar` — section filter (`<select>`) + shuffle button + deck counter
- `.card-frame` / `.card` / `.face` — 3D flip container. `.card.flipped` toggles `transform: rotateY(180deg)`; both faces use `backface-visibility: hidden`. Front and back are positioned absolutely inside the frame.
- `.card-section`, `.card-content`, `.card-flip-hint` — small celadon section label, centered card body, small uppercase keyboard hint
- `.card-nav` — prev/next pair below the card; deck wraps at both ends
- Card data lives in a JS `cards` array of `{ section, front, back }`. `front` and `back` are HTML strings that may contain `<span class="ko">…</span>` for Korean.

## Section IDs

Cheat-sheet sections use `id="sN"` (e.g. `#s12`). The practice page mirrors these exactly so deep links work both directions. The flash-cards deck uses the same `sN` strings as filter values. When adding a section, add it in all three files with the same ID, and add the cross-links in both directions.

## Translation/pronunciation policy

- **No romanization.** Anywhere. Both repos.
- The cheat sheet uses inline `(English)` parenthetical glosses inside `<pre>` blocks and small `.en` glosses below Korean examples in table cells.
- The reading guide uses IPA in `[brackets]` via `.ipa`, never romanization.
- Korean example sentences should always have an English meaning gloss; pure conjugation/morphology demonstrations don't need one.

## Mobile invariants (verified at 360 / 414 / 768)

These rules in the `≤880px` media query exist for specific reasons — don't relax them without re-running a Playwright audit:

- `pre { white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: keep-all; overflow-wrap: anywhere; }` — Korean syllables stay intact, English wraps. Without `keep-all` Korean breaks mid-word.
- `table { display: block; overflow-x: auto; white-space: nowrap; } table td, table th { white-space: normal; }` — wide tables become independently scrollable; cells still wrap.
- At ≤480px: smaller `pre` and `table` font, `.ipa { white-space: normal; }` so dense IPA-heavy tables (like the reading guide drill list) fit.

## Cross-linking pattern

Each site links the other in **three places** (mirror-symmetric):

1. **Hero lede** — first paragraph
2. **A mid-page callout** — §0 Foundations here; closing graduation callout after §20 in the reading guide
3. **Footer**

If you add a new prerequisite or sequel, follow the same three-place pattern.

## Local dev

- `python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1` from this repo
- `python3 -m http.server 8766 --bind 127.0.0.1` from the reading-guide repo (different port so both can run)
- Mobile audits via Playwright MCP — viewports 360 / 414 / 768. Screenshots go to `playwright-screenshots/` (gitignored). The Playwright MCP also writes to `.playwright-mcp/` and sometimes `audit/` — both gitignored.

## Things to avoid

- **Don't broad-ignore `*.png`** in `.gitignore` — scope to specific Playwright dirs so future legitimate image assets aren't silently ignored.
- **Don't dispatch parallel subagents writing to the same file.** Have each agent emit content with `=== sN ===` markers to its own `_content_partN.html`, then a small integration script merges them. Always clean up the temp content files after merging.
- **Don't amend pushed commits** — create a new commit. Both repos are public.
- **Don't introduce romanization** even casually in comments or examples. The "no romanization" stance is a feature.
- **Don't renumber existing section IDs.** `s17` and `s22` are intentionally absent on the practice page; preserve the gap rather than renumbering to close it — external bookmarks and cross-links rely on stable IDs.
